Description: Efficient C++ optimized functions for numerical and symbolic calculus as described in Guidotti (2020) <arXiv:2101.00086>. It includes basic arithmetic, tensor calculus, Einstein summing convention, fast computation of the Levi-Civita symbol and generalized Kronecker delta, Taylor series expansion, multivariate Hermite polynomials, high-order derivatives, ordinary differential equations, differential operators (Gradient, Jacobian, Hessian, Divergence, Curl, Laplacian) and numerical integration in arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical, cylindrical, parabolic or user defined by custom scale factors.
